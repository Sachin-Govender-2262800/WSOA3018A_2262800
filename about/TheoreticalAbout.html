  <p>My character's name is Maria Auditore and she studies Medicine at Wits She has a Dragon tattoo on her arm and has a small scar on the left side of her lips.
      Due to the fact that she is an assassin some information about her that is displayed on the website is actually hidden or a lie such as with the about page which displays
       █████ ████████ instead of the actual information. This symbolises classified information. This page would be used for the lectures awarness to know what is
        happening with the character and would not be meant for any viewers reading the web page.  </p> 
        <br>
        <p>Whenever a link is clicked on when it comes to contacting Maria, it can easily be noticed that there is no way to contact her. This is done on purpouse as Maria is an
          assassin, a criminal in simple terms so there no way Maria would give off her information to the public thats why none of the links shared go to an account. Maria is all about
          secrets even never sharing the fact that she is an assassin to her friends. In the first blog on the Library of Babel she states that Maria is her pen name or atleast a fake 
          name that she uses.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>Why did I choose to make a website around an assassin? I choose her as my favoire game series Assassins Creed, this is why I decided that I would like to create a character
          as an Assassin that lived in mordern day South Africa. It also seemed allot more fun having a criminal be the focal point of this website one that thrives of having her information
          be hidden yet they still decide to share information. Their is an idea that her character may evolve from that of an assassin to also becoming a body guard type of character 
          where she'll protect potential victims of Assassins. In this way my character evolves from just being an assassin to becoming someone who protects others as well as continuing to
          assassinate those who should be assassinated as she always has. The theory blogs according to how my character is created are designed to teach users about internet safety where she can
          and to try and inform users of their rights with some of the blogs, the personal blogs are just as it says, they are based around her personal stories such as the assassination contracts or her daily life stories.
