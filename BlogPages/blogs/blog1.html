            <p>March 15 2021 by Maria Auditore.
                Before I get started on The Library of Babel I would like to introduce myself.
                 My name Maria Auditore an Italian girl with grey eyes and black hair that moved from Venice Italy when I was 4 years old to Johannesburg South Africa.
                  I wear glasses because I cannot see, my hand writing is almost unreadable and I am a secret assassin, but you would never know by looking at my shy demeanour. 
                  Being an assassin is not the only thing I do, as I work part time in a library and due to this I thought it would be appropriate to talk about the Library of Babel
                   and how it compares to that of the internet as we know it.</p>
