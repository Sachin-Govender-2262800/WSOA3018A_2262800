            <p style="font-size:120%;">When I am not posting either about myself, my experiences or something that I find interesting.
                I have so far posted about different aspects of the internet in order to help teach whoever reads them.
                 Whether that’s teaching them something based of the very internet they use to read my blogs, teaching them how to protect themselves on the internet or just so
                  they have something interesting to read. I never realized how many people I have been able to reach maybe you aren’t here just for the fact that I am an assassin
                   and are here to actually learn something. That being said it really got me thinking about of just how Accessible the internet really is, 
                   therefore todays blog will be based around the importance of accessibility. </p>

           <p style="font-size:120%;">First let’s define what accessibility means, accessibility can be broken down as the ability to access something or the user’s ability to use something regardless 
               of their condition. Web accessibility is the ability for all user’s to be able to access a website or app no matter their disability. (Emmanuel, 2018). According 
               to The World Bank 15% of the world’s population or 1 billion people have some form of disability, whether it be hearing, motor functions, vision or cognition as well 
               as the fact as many elderly people could also make use of having access to a more accessible internet, therefore it is vital that web accessibilities importance is 
               not overlooked (Geley, n.d.).  There are however 7 reasons why web accessibility should be implemented these are Legal, Reputation, Inclusivity, User Experience, 
               SEO, Coding standards as well as the fact that it is just the right thing to do (Tim, 2020). </p>

           <p style="font-size:120%;">In the legal case any digital platform that is connected to a physical location that provides good or services must also comply with accessibility standards this means
                that there can be serious legal repercussions such as with what happened with a 2020 Domino’s accessibility case. In this case a man named Robles was unable to order 
                pizza from the Dominos app due to its lack of an alt-text feature (Andy, 2019). Having accessibility towards ones app can improve the reputation of a business a prime 
                example again is Dominos which may forever be known as the company who had argued against the rights of a blind man (Tim, 2020). Inclusivity goes back towards the fact 
                that the internet should be for everyone. The user experience as a whole is improved for everyone if a website or app takes a stronger stance in improving its 
                accessibility. SEO which stands for search engine optimization, accessibility can be related back to google itself where search engine crawlers often look into 
                the user experience that you provide and will often rank it according to this usability. With coding standards one understands that by having the implementation 
                of accessibility from the get go it will create a stricter adherence to proper coding standards and thus the codes end result will be more performant and cleaner. 
                The last point that it is just the right thing to do does not need to be explained with all the previous points above. </p>

           <p style="font-size:120%;">There are many ways to make websites more accessible some examples include Alt-tags which is a description of an image, keyboard navigation for non-mouse users, 
               closed captions for media which are subtitles for videos and audio on your site, having a simple design on your site that can be used by any user regardless of 
               knowledge or experience. There are many more ways that a website can be improved to make it more accessible however if we went on with the list this blog could 
               easily become an entire thesis based around the importance of accessibility. Maybe when I retire one day I’ll do that I mean I don’t plan on ever getting caught 
               or killed. So I leave you with this dear future web designers. Remember to cater to everyone you don’t want your company to end up like Dominos.</p>
