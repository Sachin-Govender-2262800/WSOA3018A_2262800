            <p style="font-size:120%;"> Have you ever just been trying to log onto a web page where you’re suddenly hit with the age old philosophical question “Are you a robot? 
                ”Having to click on a box to prove your humanity, wondering just what type of robot would be on the internet. At first you maybe picturing a metallic figure sitting in 
                front of a computer clicking through web pages but this isn’t entirely correct there are web robots. What exactly are web robots well dear reader today’s blog will aim 
                to discuss the history of these web robots. </p>

            <p style="font-size:120%;"> Let’s understand what exactly a web bot is first, it is a program that runs automated tasks by running scripts through the internet. 
                They are able to perform structurally repetitive and simple tasks much faster than any human, in this way bots can be seen as crucial 
                for the running of the internet. This is not always the case as bots can be used negatively for destructive and malignant purposes (Knecht, 2016). 
                The first form of the start of this AI was created in the 1950’s by computer scientist Alan Turing, he created it for a game known as the Imitation Game.
                A game where 3 players where involved one of which was a robot, the third player would ask a question and both the robot and the second player would have
                to answer and the third player would have to guess who was the human (Wiener, 2017). In the 1960s ELIZA was developed whose purpose was to simulate a
                psychotherapist and was created by MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum. During this time ELIZA’s vocabulary was very limited resulting in some truly hilarious
                outcomes if you’d like to try it for yourself she can be reached at <a href ="http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/Eliza.htm">MIT's ELIZA PsychologyBot</a> (Wiener, 2017).
                At these stages AI was still very limited in the types of responses it could give as well as what they could do </p>

            <p style="font-size:120%;"> In the 1970’s to 1980’s Freddy was created. Freddy unlike those before was a nonverbal robot he wasn’t made to communicate rather to assemble simple objects, 
                he made use of a camera which gave him the ability to see and recognize the parts to be assembled. Funny enough Freddy was probably slower than having an actual human
                assemble these objects as he took 16 hours to complete his tasks. In the 1990’s to early 2000’s bots and AI had become more dedicated towards being consumer facing.
                Even early video games had been seen as a primitive consumer facing bot such as Tamagotchi. During this time there was also the creation of SmaterChild which marked 
                an important change in human history with the improvement to speaking to these bots. SmaterChild was a robot that lived in AIM (American Online Instant Messenger) 
                and had a backlog of responses to a number of questions (Wiener, 2017). This all leads us towards our modern era that we live in, the internet as a whole would not 
                be possible if not for bots. Such as Googlebot how exactly do you think we are able to find the exact pages we are looking for on something as vast as the internet? 
                Chatbots are also something used by millions of people even being able to fool allot of people into thinking that they are other people entirely. Today bots make up
                roughly half of all internet traffic but with all the goods bots can do they also bring the risks of all the negatives they could bring about (Knecht, 2016).
                Bots can be used as Malware bots, Email spam bots, cheating bots for video games such as Aimbots, Botnets, and DDoS attacks. This is why it is important to always
                be aware of what links you are clicking on as well as by having a dedicated anti-virus always being on such as Norton, Windows Defender, McAfee, BitDefender but
                this is just a few of the many paid and free anti-virus all around the world. </p>

            <p style="font-size:120%;"> Bots have been used in many ways throughout history and all their uses are still being improved and questioned. 
                20 years in the future the internet may not be recognized as it is today, the world as we know it may not be recognizable today.
                That’s if the bots don’t take over. Regardless of how you use the internet always remember to be safe for how many good bots there are there are just as many if
                not more bots used for malicious purposes. </p>
