        <article class = "main-content">
            <p> I have been posting these blogs for a couple of weeks now and as I excepted one question more than anything else asked was, “Why are you an assassin?”
                 Rather than me explaining it to everyone or me constantly putting it aside, I’ll do my best to answer as much as I can now. Today’s blog will not be based around the internet
                 or technology rather today is quiet personal blog. </p>

            <p> To any 7 year old moving to an entirely different continent would be a huge change and would be quite scary, as was my move because at this point I had been unaware
                 of what I do know of now. Throughout my childhood I was always trained by my parents and brother how to fight, use the environment to my advantage and how to survive
                  in a violent and unforgiving world. When I was 14 I stumbled onto the secret room my parents had been trying all their lives to hide from me. I guess it couldn’t be
                   helped with how thoroughly I was taught, no that’s a lie my mom was never on board with training me by my brother had convinced her to let it happen and to even 
                   participate in my lessons. When I had discovered this room my entire world had flipped, turns out my parents are from a long lineage of Assassins. This was one of
                    the major reasons we had moved not because of “better schooling” or “better Opportunities as my parents had once said, rather it was to escape, escape from who I 
                    have no idea, I haven’t met them yet. The dread on my parents face when I confronted them with the truth had said it all.  </p>

            <p> They didn’t want me to be a part of the family business rather they wanted me to escape it they only trained me so that had my life been in danger or if anything happened to them. I would have the skills
                 to survive on my own. When asked about if this had anything to do with my brothers falling out with them and eventual disappearance they didn’t answer. 
                 Ah yes my brother I have mentioned him a few times not only in this blog but in other parts of my website. When I was 11 he had a massive argument with my 
                 parents I was never able to hear what it was about but ever since then I never saw him… I still miss him allot… I hope that one day with all the skills and 
                 resources I have I’ll be able to find him. Ever since finding out about my parents little secret I never stopped my training, realising my families heritage 
                 I finally saw a way for me to change things. </p>

            <p> My first ever contract was done by me when I was 18 years old, I was tasked with killing a man who had been accused of multiple murders, kidnappings and 
                I don’t want to even think what else, there was damning evidence and the police did nothing. He had them at his pockets. I knew what had to be done. The job
                 was messy, I made a ton of mistakes even being caught for a brief moment but he thought nothing off me he only saw the defenceless girl that I portrayed. He
                  was killed swiftly where he couldn’t hurt anyone else. In the end I left no trail that could be followed and made out without alerting anyone. I was tasked 
                  to kill this man by the daughter of a father that he had murdered when he tried to protect his daughter from being one of his kidnappings. She tried paying me 
                  for the job with all her savings and inheritance but I declined she needed that money especially now. </p>

                  <p>If you haven’t figured it yet I am an Assassin, I am not a good person I’ve killed many people, only those who have harmed others or use their power to
                       hurt others. This is the only real way I feel like I can make a change, I am not encouraging what I do. If I ever get caught by the police I would happily 
                       confess I am a criminal and deserve to be locked up. Now dear reader it falls to you to figure out if I’m telling the truth or not.</p>
