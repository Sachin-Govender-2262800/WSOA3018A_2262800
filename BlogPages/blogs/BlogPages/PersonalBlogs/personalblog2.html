        <article class = "main-content">
            <p> Today’s blog will be a personal blog I know I haven’t done one of these for a while, this blog will be discussing my trip to gold reef city.
                  For those of you who don’t know Gold Reef City has a casino and theme park, we didn’t go to the casino but we did go to the theme park and 
                  this blog will discuss all that we got up too. </p>

            <p> Gold Reef City is about 14kms away from me so about may a 30 minute drive depending on traffic, it was my first time driving to there by the way. 
                My friend ██████ and I went there just as a catch up session especially since we hadn’t seen each other in about 3 months thanks to COVID and him
                 living in ███████. It was a scary drive thanks to all the taxis but it was fine we found close parking somehow and off we were to the Gold Reef theme park. 
                  I need to say this first… It is really hard for me to pretend to be normal. Half of the time I was there I was just thinking about how easy it would be to 
                  assassinate someone here. Like with the 4D ride it’s so dark in there it would be so easy… But my friend knew I was distracted, not by what he doesn’t know 
                  about my secret. It’s to keep him safe. </p>

            <p> After he shook me back to reality we enjoyed our day, we decided not to eat anything due to the fact that we wanted to ride as much as we could without throwing up.
                 We went to the Tower of Terror first scariest ride of my life I actually don’t think I could of thought about assassinations if I even tried. The log ride was fun
                  but I was so upset that my shoes got wet but you know it was still amazing, if you’re fast enough and there was no one around you could probably drown someone
                   during that ride but you would have to be fast. The miner’s revenge was so amazing. We went on so many rides and planned to go to the anaconda as our last ride,
                    spoiler alert we didn’t. </p>

            <p> We went on a swing ride that went really high in the air and the would spin around and after that ride I felt kind of sick but I didn’t say anything,
                ██████ then made us go on a small swing ride that did the same thing but wasn’t as fast… I felt so sick after the ride we looked at each other and ran 
                 to the bathrooms I threw up little in my hands and yeah… It wasn’t fun. After we got cleaned up we chilled and just sat on the grass, until we realized
                  that the theme park was going to close. So we decided to leave and buy Chicken Lickin. After I dropped ██████ off I went home and actually went to bed.</p>

                  <p>This blog had no twist and has no murders, nor anything violent. Today I wanted to just share a fun experience I had with my friend. 
                      I’m not just an assassin, I am a human too. I wasn’t always an assassin as I said before I was brought into this world of secrets by mistake do I miss 
                    being normal?
                    Yes… but I can’t go back.
                    </p>
