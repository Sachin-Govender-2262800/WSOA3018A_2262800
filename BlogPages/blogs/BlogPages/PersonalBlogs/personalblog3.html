        <article class = "main-content">
            <p> You know allot of you have been asking really important questions. Such as how have I not been caught yet? How come none of my assassinations have
                 been reported or heard off? Well it seems like it’s that time again, it’s time for a personal blog dear readers! So switch off that beautiful 
                 brain of yours and read the ramblings of what could be complete lies of how we have yet to be caught and how come you never heard of me sooner. </p>

            <p> In simple terms, it all depends on who you know! Dear reader you need to understand that we know allot of people… like… yeah, and there are allot of other 
                assassins out there well maybe a decent amount of people who are trained in secrecy as well as murder. Let’s start with examples of where our influence lies.
                 How come none of our crimes have been reported or spread well that’s simple we have people working for us making sure anything that does get spread to the
                  news or reporters is immediately made to disappear or things will seemingly malfunction. There’s also allot of rumours that go around based off our killings. 
                  First of all we have a common calling card that signifies that the crime was committed by us… for obvious reasons of the common thug using it I can’t in good
                   faith say what it is. Due to the calling card reports are weary of the rumours of what might happen if they report on one of our assassinations. </p>

            <p>Now when it comes to the police… I’m pretty sure none of you would be surprised if I said that the police are corrupt especially in our country,
                 fun story every time I’ve been pulled over for speeding I always offer the police some coke and R500 and they usually let me off. Allot of the
                  assassinations are cleaned up by cleaning crews we have in our order, they make sure any evidence that could expose the group is collected and they 
                  often do as their name says and clean up the crime scene. However even if they are unable to fully do their job we have multiple connections in all kinds 
                  of police and government organisations. With a simple request all information gathered about us disappears. That’s why the police to those no involved don’t
                   even know that someone was killed. In the end it does cost allot to make someone disappear it was almost like you weren’t even here in the first place. If
                    you recall correctly I stated in my contact page that if you hire me, that should I be caught or killed all information about our interaction would be complete 
                    removed as if we never knew each other or of each other’s existence. That is because I almost immediately of accepting the contract will get rid of this 
                    information and if I don’t get rid of everything I have family and others in our order willing to remove everything. If it was really necessary I myself 
                    might be assassinated if there is no chance of my rescue. </p>

            <p> Hope that this reasoning is enough to satisfy the curios nature of those out there who keep sending me messages about this topic. 
                And to those of you who have been reporting this website to the authorities just know… That request to know your location was actually
                 just a joke… because I already know where you are, so please keep reporting me ;) I can’t wait to visit you soon… or not maybe I am lying.  </p>
