        <article class = "main-content">
            <p> Hey dear readers, today won’t be a lesson on the internet or a personal story about my going out, rather today I would like to answer a question that has been going 
                around. Why, more precisely why did you decide to create a website? I never thought that I would answer this but today I felt it was necessary to explain why I 
                decided to make a website. </p>

            <p> In simple terms I created this website as a way to spread awareness of well my life… Now I’m not saying that I want to get caught or that I want my family to
                 get caught. Rather id want you to be more careful on the internet and in public. I tell you I how I think and how I go about my days so that if you’re out you
                  have chance to think of what would an assassin do? That might seem like a silly reason but if you really think about it how would you know that you’re not on 
                  a contract to be killed? You wouldn’t is the answer if their even half as good as an assassin as me… I’m not saying this to scare you I made this website to 
                  tell you my story, well as much as I can say.  As well as the fact that I want you to know that there are evil people in this world as much we try to pretend
                   everything is ok, it’s really not.  I want you to know that there are people that stand for what is right, and I’m not going to pretend I am a saint… the act 
                   of taking a life takes allot out of you and I am by no means an angel. I will only kill if I can deem that the contract is indeed warranted and that the target
                    is actually causing other people pain.  </p>

            <p>Now I am definitely not saying let’s all go on a killing spree and kill everyone who ever hurt another person. I want you to be aware that people are evil and there
                 are things you can do and I don’t mean hiring me, call the police as corrupt as they can be… some of them are actually here to help you. When it comes to the 
                 information I spread about the internet this is done so that you are aware of your rights and can be aware of when a website or company is taking advantage of 
                 you. You are as in much danger on the internet as you are in real life and again I’m not trying to scare you that’s why I’ve made my site. </p>

            <p>Now you might be thinking why exactly an assassin would want to inform you how to take care of yourself rather than just lying to you… well I never wanted to be an 
                assassin but it’s the life I was brought into, however, I’ve always wanted to help people… its why I study medicine. I don’t see myself as an assassin rather someone
                 who needs to get rid of people who are causing harm to others, and those type of people are likely never going to read this website and even if they did… If I was
                  hunting you… you’d be dead already :). Below I am going to list a number of actual numbers that you can call in South Africa if you are in danger or need help.  </p>
