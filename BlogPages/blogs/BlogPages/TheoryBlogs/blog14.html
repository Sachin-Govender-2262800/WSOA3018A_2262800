            <p>Here is a small fact for all of you out there! I hated geography in high school that’s why I never took it. Now today’s blog is not going to be a personal blog of
                 me winning about geography or high school, todays blog is about Information Geography and why it matters, this can be linked back to one of my previous blogs
                  about Graham et al. - 2015 - Towards a study of information geographies, so if you want further readings on this please engage with that. 
                 </p>


                

            <p> We need to understand that information Geography is the study of places and the relationships between people and their environment and can be split into two forms 
                of geography. This being Physical geography which is the study of the Earth and its seasons, climates, soil, streams, atmosphere, oceans and landforms and the second
                 is Human Geography which is the study of humans and the data that is produced of that such as internet access (WHAT IS GEOGRAPHY?, n.d.). To further understand what
                  information Geography we need to understand GIS. GIS or Geographic Information Systems is a computer system that manages, creates, analyses and maps different 
                  kinds of data related to positions on Earth’s surface. GIS can be used to illuminate and identify issues around specific areas and allows for these problems to 
                  be addressed (What Is GIS?, n.d.). At the end of my blog is a short video created by Esri Ireland that briefly explains GIS to provide additional information and to
                   further explain it. Now the question becomes who is this data that is gathered important? 
                </p>

            <p>
                In terms of retail and business one must understand that we are in an era of geospatial consumerism, having this information assist business with understanding where 
                particular services and products would be more popular. This information can also be used and applied to emergency planning, disaster responses and overall crisis
                 management. Data is provided in real-time and allows data analysist to know what exactly is happening is specific area especially after a disaster. This information
                  can be further be used to analyse crime rates in different areas and analyse the time activity that these crimes may take place, this allows authorities to better
                   time their routes to ensure they are watching over specific areas at specific times (Landry, 2016). This information can be further used for data analysing geographies
                    of information distribution, this analyses how many people really have access to different forms of technology such as the number of internet users that are around
                     and can then further be analysed to view how many users in different countries actively have access to this internet access.

                This blog was not to try and influence any high school kids that they should consider taking geography, I still kind of hate it ^^. But even I understand its importance to
                 helping better understand what is happening in the world and allows for specific measures to be taken to try and solve what can be solved. I hope you enjoyed today’s blog 
                 and if you want any more information on this I encourage that you look at my previous blog it was my 8th blog.
