        <article class = "main-content">
            <p>Technology has changed every aspect of our lives and has in some way affected and played a big role in most people’s lives. 
                One of the most prominent development in technology is the internet itself, the internet is all around, literally being known as the World Wide Web 
                and is easily accessible through different devices such as computers, tablets and the phones that most people carry along with them in everyday life. 
                With the internet being so widely available it allows different people with all sorts of different backgrounds to be able to create their own Content on the internet.
                 This User Generated Content brings on its own positive and negative features and this blog aims to further discuss these factors. </p>

            <p>User Generated Content or UGC can be defined as content such as blogs, videos, images, 
                audio and other forms of media that is created and shared by the online users on a social media platform (Ogino, 2017). 
                One of the biggest platforms filled with UGC is YouTube which is solely based and built on it, where over 500 hours’ worth of videos is uploaded by
                 its users every minute (Stanimirovic, 2021). With how accessible the internet has been it has created a platform for users to share their opinions, 
                 beliefs and allows them to reach out to a larger audience then they normally would of through way of mouth. This however displays an initial fact UGC 
                 cannot be controlled and the way this media is used is entirely up to those who made created the content whether it be fake news, memes, music videos or 
                 even a discussion on a forum, this is where UGC thrives the most as it creates a form of authenticity that cannot be replicated (Ogino, 2017).</p>

            <p>From a business standpoint positively User Generated Content can be used to market a business, 
                it can be a cost efficient form of advertising for smaller companies to reach a target audience 
                while also improving customer engagement (Box, 2020). Going back to the authenticity of UGC the 
                biggest form of advertising comes with user reviews, whether this is of the company or product. 
                Where users are more likely to trust the words of other customers rather than that of the marketing coming from the company itself. 
                This in itself is also a big negative as companies are at risk of having a false narrative spread around the product or company itself, 
                and there is no real way to prevent this other than regular monitoring of the content the company promotes. 
                UGC requires companies to not only have a form of social media presence but one they must maintain in order to succeed (Box, 2020). </p>

            <p>Moving away from this Business sense of User Generated Content we look at it from a more social point of view. 
                The idea that anyone can post one of their own thoughts and ideas is an amazing they are able to find likeminded people and make a real difference. 
                Such as with how users are able to discuss and point out injustices in the world. 
                The internet has been a platform for social protests and resistance to be created and has helped made others aware of the issues in the world such as that of the 
                Hong Kong or Ukraine protests against the government that was only brought to light thanks to social media (Furedi, 2014) . In other ways UGC has helped people 
                connect with each other with music, memes, YouTube and other forms of media it allows people to discover and 
                learn more not only about themselves but others as well, they can learn about different cultures, stories, beliefs or even just interesting facts about the world 
                itself. This influx of information however, is not always to be believed with how easy it is to create a discussion in modern times, the spread of false news as 
                well as fake media can easily flourish. In most cases these false narratives cannot be determined without further investigation, which unfortunately most people 
                do not have enough time to do.</p>

            <p>User Generated Content has been one of if not the most influential things in modern human society and can influence different people’s 
                thoughts and ideas and can not only impact business but society as a whole. Just like everything it also portrays some positive and negative elements, 
                however this in the end is impacted on what message you want to create when you decide to post something to a larger audience.</p>
