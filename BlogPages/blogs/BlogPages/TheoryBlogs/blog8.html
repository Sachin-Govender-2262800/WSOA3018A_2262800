        <article class = "main-content">
            <p> Today we are going to do something a little different dear reader. Today I would like to have a discussion on a reading I did which is the reading
                 of Graham et al’s “Toward a study of information geographies”. It will be a discussion of the reading, this is a new form of blog that I am trying
                  out so let me know if you enjoy the content and maybe we can do more. As you are already aware I love reading so this was something I wanted to try for a while.
                   The reading explains and explores how information geographies have their own geographic distributions, such as geographies of access, of participation and of
                    representation. 
                 </p>

            <p> One must understand that information has its own geography, if it is from somewhere or about somewhere then the information is evolved and transforms, it is then
                 mediated by networks, infrastructure and technologies that all take up a physical space. This information is how we on the internet are able to learn information
                  about places and will determine how we understand these different parts of the world (Graham et al., 2015, p.88). Information can be considered as a mobile as there
                   is always the movement and transmission of information when moving from one place to another. There is are restrictions to keep 
                   information’s mutability (The likelihood of being changed) as defined by Latour (1986) who refers to “immutable mobiles” which is the
                    ability to transfer information without significant change to its meaning or characteristics (Graham et al., 2015,p.88 – p89).  
                    The reading explains that the geography of information distribution represents a form of control and power. As can be seen with the
                     distribution of access of different Geographies, as can be seen from data from 2011 China had been seen with the largest internet 
                     population with over half a billion users and were followed by India, the United states and Japan.  There is however a large number 
                     of users who are unable to have access to the internet showing an unevenness in the geography of internet access but this can also be 
                     attributed towards Broadband affordability  (Graham et al., 2015,p.91 – p93).  To actually gauge the participation of different geographical
                      locations there are three different variables this being domain names to indicate the different content on the Web, GitHub users as an indication
                       of how many contributions there are too largest open software repository and Wikipedia edits. All these represent different communities of practice 
                       as can be seen within the illustrations displaying these numbers (Graham et al., 2015, p.94 – p97).  .  
                </p>

            <p> Geographies of representation is another point brought on by the discussion, to better understand the different representations within the (im)mutable augmentations
                 of the world they had analysed the geographies of different digital representations such as Open Street Map, Google Search and the Semantic Web. Google searches can 
                 impact the representation of different places the study had analysed different countries search histories by name of the county itself. The United States had the
                  largest number of mentions followed by Japan, China and The United Kingdom. These numbers were then displayed in chart of theirs displayed in the research. They
                   then Mapped the Open Streen Map, what they had mapped was the different nodes of each cell this displaying how much content each country had displayed with all 
                   the nodes present in it, The United States again had the largest total amount, however Netherlands had the highest density of content. In terms of the Semantic
                    Web they had analysed the total number of georeferenced objects within a country such as for example searches around asking “what is the capital of France”. 
                    The United States had contained the largest concentration of Freebase. This entire paper uses data to display the different geographies if access with addition 
                    to the uneven geographies of participation in this data, not ever country has the appropriate access to participate in these research analysed in the data
                     displayed.

                </p>

            <p>I hope you as my readers enjoyed this form of blog post if you did please let me know. This was as Graham et al’s “Toward a study of information geographies”.
                 I don’t think I could ever relay all the information that was placed into the study but I tried my best and I recommend that you should read the study yourself
                  maybe you’ll be able to gauge your own understanding or pick up on something I may have forgotten about. I hope that today you all learnt something new! I will
                   be leaving a link to the reading as usual I hope if you have the time you will give it a good read.
                 </p>
