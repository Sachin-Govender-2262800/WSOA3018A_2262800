            <p> After creating this entire website filled with information about my life and information about the internet itself, I’ve realized something. 
                Creating a web site is hard work and if you want people to actually view your site you need to make it not only look good but make it satisfying
                 to use but not only that I need to ensure that my site is accessible and useable to anyone who may access it. If you haven’t guessed already today’s blog 
                 dear reader will delve into what exactly is Web Accessibility and Usability.
                 </p>

            <p> Let’s break down what exactly web site usability and accessibility is. Usability can be seen as the level of efficient, effectiveness and satisfaction a user 
                experiences while learning how to use the website at hand and can be reflected with how fast the user learn the website and how easy it is for them to remember
                 how to use it (Mifsud, n.d.). Accessibility on the web can be seen as a way of ensuring people with disabilities are able to interact, perceive, understand and
                  contribute with a website. These disabilities may range from people with auditory, visual, cognitive, speech and neurological disabilities. However accessibility 
                  is not limited to only disabled people rather it can also be beneficial and vital for those who use devices with smaller screens such a phones, for those who have
                   temporary disabilities such as a broken arm, those users with slow internet or even simple limitations such as being in a noisy environment or being in
                    sunlight (Bigby, 2019).
                </p>

            <p> 
                Understanding Usability and Accessibility it can be noted that they aren’t completely different in principal however they each address a different issue. 
                 Understanding that usability deals with the users ease of use and can be determined by the websites visual design, page layout, organisation, navigation and 
                 content. Web accessibility can be seen as webpages being designed for individuals with all forms of disabilities however this benefits all types of users. This
                  form of cross-functionality within a website can be seen with captions on a video as this not only helps users with hearing or visual impairments but can also
                   be noted as helping users who are in a noisy environment (Akinyemi, 2020). In this way Accessibility can be determined as a subset of usability but this does
                    not mean that just because a website is accessible that it is in turn usable or vice versa. Accessibility and usability can be tested in a variety of ways,
                    one of the best ways to test a websites accessibly and usability is to have real people test it. Instead of having project managers or web developers testing
                    it out, it would be better to have different people with all forms of disabilities and different forms of limitations testing a website (Bigby, 2019).
                </p>

            <p>To ensure that your website is able to bring people in and that those users are able to make full use of your website, accessibility and usability
                 needs to go hand in hand and must always be in the mind of the developers while creating and testing’s their website. The internet is a place for all
                  that is why we need to create an inclusive web that treats and values everyone as equals.
