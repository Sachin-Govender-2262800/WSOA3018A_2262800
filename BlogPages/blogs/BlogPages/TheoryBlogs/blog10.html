            <p> You would never guess how truly amazing it is that you are even able to read this blog, or how amazing it is that I am able to write this blog. 
                The type of things we are able to do with computers is almost always increasing especially as technology improves and evolves, However, the continually improvement 
                of our technology means nothing to those who are unable to access it weather that be at its full potential or at all. This goes into the term known as the Digital 
                Divide and todayâ€™s blog will delve deeper into this divide.
                 </p>

            <p> The Digital Divide can be defined as a gap between those who have access to modern information and communication technology and those who lack this access, or have restricted access. 
                Examples of these forms of technology can be seen with phones, computers, the internet and television (Steele, 2019).  The Digital Divide can be seen in our modern education
                 system as it has had more of an impact especially due to the Coronavirus Pandemic creating a world where distance learning a norm, in this way it becomes more of an issue for
                  those who do not have access to technology or even stable internet (TSDF, 2020). This gap becomes even larger when regions come into play, as can be seen with data taken in 
                  May of 2020 it was found that only 39.3% of inhabitants in Africa have internet access compared to the 94.6% of Americans and 87.2% of Europeans (Iberdrola, 2020).  
                  There are 3 types of Digital Divide this being, 1 the Gender Divide where woman are less likely to have access to the internet or own a phone which shows the gender 
                  gap in mobile connectivity. 2 there is the Social Divide as people without access to the internet cannot reap the benefits of interaction with online peer groups.
                   Lastly there is a Universal Access Divide those individuals who have disabilities may have issues accessing different hardware and software as well as those who have
                    a lower education or poor broad band infrastructure (Examples of the Digital Divide in the Modern Day, n.d.). 
                </p>

            <p> There are different reasons for the digital divide these include Education, Income levels, Geographical restrictions, digital literacy and Motivation as well as
                 General interest (Steele, 2019). There are however ways to bridge the gap of the Digital Divide. These are some of the most relevant ones, Creating digital Literacy
                  programs, these will help teach those who are in less favoured areas of the internet. Alliance for affordable internet which is a project led by the international
                   coalition of governments, civil society and business which aims to lower the cost of broadband. Free basics a project promoted by Facebook as well as others that
                    aim to provide free access to a number of websites through a mobile application (Iberdrola, 2020). There are however many other ways of bridging the gap that has
                     been created and headed by many companies and individuals all of which who aim to create an equal and fair technological future.

                </p>

            <p>Technology has improved our lives greatly and has allowed many of us to connect with each as well as provided us access to many opportunities in our lives that many
                 others may either only get later in life or may never even be able to access. With that in mind never forget how truly amazing it is that you are even able to read
                  this blog, and I thank you for reading it.
                 </p>
