        <article class = "main-content">
            <p>This is a blog post, we all know this, but what is the message of these blogs I have been posting? 
                To understand that we need to discuss the message of the medium it’s on. I have been able to communicate and spread information with everyone reading 
                this thanks to the internet. Today I would like to discuss the expression that was coined by a man who predicted the internet as we know it almost 30 years
                 before it was even invented and explain how this impacts the way we understand the web. </p>

            <p>We live in day an age where almost everyone has access to some form of communication, moving from the past where we once had only had accessed 
                to information through way of mouth or what we saw on television now we are able to communicate and share information through such forms as sending text messages,
                 being able to phone each other, send letters or emails. Something to consider is, what is the message? One would easily say it is the content within the medium 
                 but what if the medium itself portrayed its own message. The medium is the message an expression coined by Canadian Philosopher Marshall McLuhan, a phrase he liked 
                 so much he wrote a book about it. Marshall would in his book Understanding Media define a medium as an extension of ourselves understanding this we can identify
                  that in the way we decide to communicate or the medium has as much if no more value than the message itself (Gross, 2011). We can see this simply in the messages
                   that certain mediums create, emails are seen as much more formal, texts are seen as something more casual, and hand written letters are seen as more personal and
                    caring these are just a few examples. How does this affect how we understand the internet?</p>

            <p>The internet itself is a medium and if you do not understand the medium itself you do not understand the message. 
                Mediums have changed how we as people behave through our collective engagement due to mass media. Social media has 
                been a way for others to spread a message in a way that is able to be accessed by users who normally would be unaware,
                 people of different languages, cultures or even people whole continents away. Having this much power social media has 
                 been the reason for various cultural events (Eudaimonia, 2016). The internet allows for the creation and spread of companies
                  made to help fight the injustices of the world. There is however negatives that are created from this. With the expansion of 
                  technology and the internet it creates as McLuhan had believed, an absence of privacy (Eudaimonia, 2016). Weather it is 
                  how governments monitor citizens or how we as users will often feel compelled to share information online. This information 
                  can in itself have very negative consequences and what goes on the internet more or less stays on the internet forever.</p>

            <p>How you decide to use your power on the internet is entirely up to you but the message you are trying to portray needs to always be considered. 
                I aim to arm you with information of the very thing you currently on, but how I go about this in itself has to be considered. The medium is the message 
                portrays the idea that the medium in which a message is experienced will in the end shape how the user’s perception of the message is shaped. Speaking about 
                messages studies have shown that due to digital technology our memory spans have been reduced and that is why every blog I have posted has been kept in a short 
                format.</p>
