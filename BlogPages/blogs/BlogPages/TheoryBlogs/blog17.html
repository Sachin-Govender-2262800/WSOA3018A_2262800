        <article class = "main-content">
            <p>This is my first ever created website, it is not the best out there but I believe it is not the worst website out there either. As an assassin sometimes you 
                realise that you cannot do all of your jobs without external help or intervention. The same can be said about creating a website, when creating a website 
                there are times where you need to make use of an external resources in order to achieve the goal you want. Today’s blog will be discussing the external 
                dependencies that my website makes use of and why I believe that they are important for my website. 
                 </p>


                

            <p> 
                First let’s understand what exactly an external dependency is in terms of websites. It is an input that comes from an external source and it is required in 
                order for the task to be performed, it is in no real way able to be influenced by the websites creator however it can be manipulated and used for the websites
                 needs (External Dependency Definition, 2021). There are 5 forms of dependencies functional, fully functional, transitive, multivalued and partial dependency. 
                 External dependencies can take on the forms of API’s or application programming interface. An API is a set of functions as well as procedures which allows your
                  product or service, in this case my website to access data and features of other applications, products or services without having to know how they are
                   implemented (Siegel & Dorairajan, 2020). There are 2 external dependencies in my website and 1 internal dependency. The internal dependency uses the
                    history of the user on my website and when the button that is linked to this history is pressed the website will take the user back to the previous 
                    page, this is used for all the blogs.
                
                </p>

            <p>
                In terms of the external dependencies there are the Geolocations used as well as the COVID stats these are all seen within the contact page of my website. 
                The Geolocations come in the form of the map that is displayed which shows a highlighted part of Johannesburg city as well as a button which will display the
                 users co-ordinates in the form of longitude and latitude and will send it to me so I am aware of your location… you did ask to meet
                  me ^^ (In terms of my character she would say this however the location is never sent to any external part or server this information is lost almost 
                  immediately there is no risk of a user’s location being sent anywhere).  The second external dependency comes from the table that displays COVID stats
                   provided from <a href = "https://corona.lmao.ninja/v2/countries/south%20africa">https://corona.lmao.ninja/v2/countries/south%20africa</a>. This is provided as if you wish to hire me for any contracts, depending on the number 
                   of cases and how bad the numbers are, it will affect how much the job will do and also weather I will be completing the task at all. This is due to a few 
                   reasons that were listened in my contact page. 
               
               </p>  

               <p>
                   
                These were seen as necessary for my site because, as an assassin sending me your location makes it easier for me to track you down if I need to get something from you
                 or maybe I’ll pay you a visit ^^. The map is important to display the area that I currently am working in especially due to COVID restrictions. The map may be
                  updated in the future or removed all together but that is all based around the second API that being from the COVID stats table this is to provide potential 
                  contractors to know that if they wish to hire me depending on how high the numbers are will affect just how much they need to pay me as there are allot more 
                  variables to consider now.  



               </p>
                
           

               <p>There are a bunch of other forms of API’s I could of implemented such as for the Geolocation I wanted to initially provide locations in Johannesburg where there 
                   could have been potential meet ups for my contacts, however this would require my to provide billing information into google which as you can imagine wasn’t going
                    to happen as I am not giving away any form of personal information such as my bank details into google. So this had to be removed as it would display watermarks
                     on the map and would provide the user no real information. There was also the idea to add a text to speech API for my website, especially for the blogs. This
                      was an idea that was thought of after talking about usability and accessibility I felt that it would have been a nice feature however adding this is completely
                       out of my skill group especially with my current level of understanding how to make a website. There is an important question to ask, how this affects the 
                       technical impact on my website. The Geolocation can be used more accurately on mobile devices however computers are still able to prove a relatively close
                        if not exact location when acting for the users location, in terms of the map there isn’t really a real affect however users can zoom into the map using
                         their fingers on mobile devices. In terms of the COVID stats provider this means ever so often when information is provided to the origin site, my website 
                         will be updated with this information as well. 
                </p>


               

           <p> This is why I deem the external dependencies I made use of in my website are important and needed to be used in creating my website. I wish I had the ability to create
                these features on my own and in the future I just might be able too. Currently however I am still learning how to create a website but I still feel that my website 
                can still be improved upon so please remember to provide comments on how I can improve my site.
           </p>
