        <article class = "main-content">
            <p> I have, unless my memory fails me written two blogs on UX and UI design. These being What UX and UI design are and why they are important to a website and the 
                second blog was on the ethics of UX and UI design. In these blogs I had asked you to please inform me about what could be changed with my website and any criticisms.
                 Well today I would like to discuss my own UX and UI designs.
                 </p>

            <p> I would just like to remind you if for some reason you forgot or this is your Before I get critical I would like to inform you once again, this is the first time
                 I’ve ever decided to create a website. It’s not for a company and I have no real end goal for what the website should ideally look like, this is my site that 
                 I’ve been making for myself. In the making of my site there has been a few guidelines that I’ve been following these tell me what should be in the site and what
                  shouldn’t be in the site, some people might consider these as assignments but there just my personal list of what should be in my site. In its simplest form I 
                  have done everything that has been asked of me. However whenever I was tasked with doing something I would always just do it rather than considering why it has
                   to be done or for who it has to be done for. I never really had an outside perspective when analysing my website I never really considered how the user would
                    interact with my site. However to better analyse my site I found a website that provides 10 principles of good web design this comes from Friedman (2021). 
                    The 10 ways to do is to: Not make users think, not to squander the users patience, Manage to create focus for the users, strive for feature exposure, to
                     make use of effective writing, make everything as simple as possible, not to be afraid of white space, communicate effectively, to remember that 
                     conventions are our friends and to test often and early.
                </p>

            <p>
                My site may not make use of everything here, and I will strive to test out my site more as I develop it. However in my personal non critical look of my site 
                I feel as if I have done an ok job the site does what you want it to do, when you click on a link or button it does what it should do, my site is not the prettiest
                 or most detailed one but I feel as if It fits me these are colours that I love and that’s what my site is made up off.  
               </p>
