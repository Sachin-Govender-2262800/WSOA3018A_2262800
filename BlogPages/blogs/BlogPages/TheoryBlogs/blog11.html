        <article class = "main-content">
            <p> Now I know what you are thinking an assassins is talking about ethics, isn’t that weird? Well unlike the ethics of weather what I do is ethical
                 or not today we are going to be discussing the ethical implementation of UX and UI. I have spoken about UX and UI in a previous blog post and I 
                 have brought up the ethical implementations before but this blog post will go more in depth. So get comfy my favourite readers.
                 </p>

            <p> If you haven’t read my previous blogs or just forgot lets define what UX and UI mean this User Experience and User Interface. These both
                 have many different layers to it, and will all affect how a user ends up interacting with a product. There are many different ways to perform 
                 UX and UI research and not all companies will have the same way in how they conduct this research they may not even have specified roles dedicated 
                 towards this research (Yocco, 2020). In our modern technological society with the addition of new technology comes the addition of more ethical dilemmas.
                  This is why research into these topics are important (side note this is why I often asked you to tell me about how I could improve my site in my previous
                   UX and UI blog post) it is troublesome for a designer to have fellow designers testing out the product rather than having those they are creating the product
                    for to test it. Designers such as Noah Abbott spoke about 5 of his toughest challenges when it came to creating an ethical UX design. These being: how UX
                     design impacts our mental health, User testing with different communities and cultures, making use of Inclusive design as well as the importance of accessibility
                      for all, dealing with sensitive subjects and asking how we can we adopt a more ethical approach (Abbott, 2019).  This showing just how much thought needs to go
                       into the creation of a products UX and UI. 
                </p>

            <p>
                When it comes to the ethics of UX and UI a question has to be asked, What is more important creating a UX designed for the Users rights or designing something 
                that best benefits the company. A dilemma is creating to show the advantage of the user buying the product while also maintaining user freedom to choose to decline 
                entirely, if a user has to make a purchase it is a big choice to be making because when a user signs into a website or purchases a product they are often giving away
                 important information such as. Their personal information, information about their business or their financial information (Savage, 2020). Too move away from the
                  user’s interest and move towards a more business focused product we come to a term that was coined by cognitive scientist Harry Brignull known as dark 
                  patterns (Kim, 2019). There are different forms of dark patterns such as Bait and switch where the UI I may state one thing but does something entirely 
                  different, Hidden costs are there when purchasing a product but the product itself becomes useless without additional costs, Covert Ads are there in forms
                   of banners that trick the user by appearing as website content (Kim, 2019). There are many more forms of dark patterns but these are just a few to name.
                
                </p>

            <p>However instead of just explaining the troubles faced by designers lets discuss how they could potentially create something that maintains an ethical intent behind.
                 1 Fool proof every decision made by the user in this way we prevent the users from regretting a decision such as no saving their work, 2 be the good person in this
                  way we ask what would we expect to happen and how would we feel about certain actions such being subscribing to a mailing list without any real control over the 
                  action, 3 look into already made User Experience tools created to help designers, 4 don’t make accessing data difficult when a user clicks on options it should be
                   immediate and not require multiple pages, 5 be able to change based on feedback, 6 compare you product to that of your competitors and see how you can improve your 
                   own sight while seeing any issues their site has to avoid and 7 when making changes do it in small iterations rather than completely changing an entire
                    product (Yonatan, n.d.). 
                 </p>

                 <p>I hope that these blog posts about UI and UX have been informative to you and that you take away that keeping the user in mind while creating your product is 
                     necessary. Again I will ask you to please tell me what you think I could be doing better with my site I can always improve. This is my first ever created website
                      and I would really appreciate the feedback. </p>
