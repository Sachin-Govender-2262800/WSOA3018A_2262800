        <article class = "main-content">
            <p> Hello all I appreciate the comments that you all make and the questions that you guys ask to my social media accounts, however, 
                I know all of you want to ask more about my assassin lifestyle and the family business but I really appreciate it if you guys could
                 also mention how your finding my website and blogs as a whole! It’s my first website I’ve ever created and I would appreciate the
                  feedback on it, to further explain why I would appreciate the comments is basically the topic of today’s blog and that is UX and UI
                   and how exactly do we analyse and criticise it.
                 </p>

            <p> The most important thing is understanding what exactly is UX which stands for user experience design and UI which stands for user interface design.
                UX as Don Norman would describe it as “User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, 
                and its products” (LAMPRECHT, 2021). UX can be defined as the experiences the users feel while using a website whether it be negative, positive or neutral.
                 UI simply can be understood as anything the user is able to interact with while using a digital service or product and this could include 
                 screens, sounds, keyboard, touch screens and even lights (USERTESTING, 2018). Understanding this we can delve into how to analyse UI and UX, however, one must
                  also consider what is the purpose of these reviews. Reviewing a websites UI and UX can improve the products performance in a cost effective and fast manner,
                   it helps create recommendations for the future, helps fix problems with existing products and helps get a fresh look at the product from a different perspective
                    as well as many more reasons (Białek, 2020).
                </p>

            <p> 
                User researchers have a long comprehensive lists on the different methods of how UX and UI should be but at the centre of all this is the user and how they think and
                 behave as well as their needs and motivation. According to (PHILIPS, n.d.) there are two main user research types mainly Quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative 
                 is used to quantify the problem by generating data that can be transformed into usable statistics, qualitative research is the direct assessment of behaviour baes on
                  the researcher’s observation. There are, however, other methods of reviewing the UX and UI for your product. There are 7 examples of these according to (Białek, 2020),
                   these being:
                </p>

            <p>
                 <liWeb>1. Comparing your product with your competition.</liWeb>
                <liWeb>2. Taking a step back to gain a new perspective.</liWeb>
                <liWeb>3. Focus on the important customer needs.</liWeb>
                <liWeb>4. Reduce the cost of software development.</liWeb>
                <liWeb>5. Re-evaluate your products go to market strategy. </liWeb>
                <liWeb>6. Align the interest of all the businesses stakeholders.</liWeb>
                <liWeb>7. Lastly ensure you have created a clear and simple roadmap for your next steps. </liWeb>
                 </p>

                 <p>Ensuring your website or product maintains a strong UX and UI can determine the
                    success of it and can ensure you maintain a stronger user basis, weather that is seen with the amount of returning customers or a high traffic of users visiting and 
                    reading a young girls blogs. This dear reader is why I appreciate all you support and would be very grateful if next time you reached out to me instead of it being 
                    the obvious questions about me, you could comment on your experience on my website.
