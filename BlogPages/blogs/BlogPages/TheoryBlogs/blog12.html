            <p> As an assassin I try my best not be bias and I think I’ve done an amazing job at it, I only kill those I deem to be a real threat to others I even took a test
                 about! How exciting is that. As a society we have truly come a long way from the injustices that were done in the past but we by no means ready to say we have
                  solved everything… far from it.  Today’s blog post will be discussing the Bias test I took as well as how Bias intent can impact software development.
                 </p>

            <p> To start with the test I took it can be accessed at <a href ="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/southafrica/">Implicit Association Test</a> If I am completely honest the site was hard for me to get
                 started with I was pretty confused at first but I think we can attribute it that to me being tired. There were different tests to take based around another person’s
                  Sexuality, Skin-Tone, Weight, Gender, Age, Race and even Different Countries. Now just remember that this test does not inherently dictate how you feel about these
                   different people for example when I did the test about sexuality it said I had a slight bias towards straight people, which I feel is quiet untrue but it did 
                   provide information that put everything into perspective. No matter how unbiased you truly feel it is hard to put yourself away from what you were taught or
                    how you were raised. The tests weren’t long but weren’t inherently short either the quizzes would start by asking your personal you a few questions and then 
                    have you match word or pictures to 2 rows showing a red X if you got it wrong, it did kind of feel like it went on for a bit but it was a really interesting 
                    experience. An experience I feel should be displayed with most software creators.
                </p>

            <p>
                When it comes to software development there are 2 forms of bias these being the conscious and unconscious bias. Unconscious bias is known as implicit bias were
                 people may give certain groups different qualities or characteristic this is known as stereotyping. Conscious bias however are intentional and controllable unlike 
                 implicit bias (Marsh, 2020). How can this affect software development in this case we can look at a Military veteran’s personal account to bias known as Matthew 
                 Cowsert. Let’s start with the positive stereotypes he was described as someone who was capable of taking and giving orders, he was experienced at people management
                  and he was excellent at supply chain operations, the 2 in the beginning were accurate while the last was not. 2 negative stereotypes that were expressed to him 
                  which are not accurate was that he had an inability to think outside the box and was not effective in working with an informal authoritarian 
                  environment (Cowsert, 2020). Now these were all necessarily harmful stereotypes but there are many different forms and allot which can be negative without having 
                  any real merit behind it. The question then becomes how can we remove bias from software here are some examples of how we can remove it all these come from the book
                   Race After Technology by associate professor if African America studies Ruha Benjamin. Understanding the connections and make racial fixes visible, Tackle any 
                   discriminatory designs by automatic racial habits in systems code and remember to identify them when you design and build, when a bias is found it should be dealt 
                   with more seriously compared to that of a glitch or defect and ensure that all automated systems make use of data is up to date and does not make use of anything
                    exclusive or discriminatory (Kiyanda, 2020). There are many other ways to prevent these bias from manifesting within Software however it is much harder to prevent 
                    unconscious bias and conscious bias comes up from an individual’s schooling and the environment they grew up in that’s much harder to control, businesses need to 
                    ensure that if a direct and harmful bias is spotted the proper measures need to be taken before there is major fallout to the company. 
                

                </p>

            <p>Overall it is hard to spot that an inherit bias may be within you individually, as it may not be a conscious thing but as long as you make sure that you yourself are not
                 hurting anything then I know we won’t be meeting anytime soon as you can definitely count your blessing on that. I highly recommend that you do the test that I have 
                 provided within this blog post!
