            <p>I have been posting these blogs for a short period of time now and I have felt that I have gotten close to many of you.
                 In this closeness however I have been made aware of just how oblivious you all are of the very thing you use to read my blog posts. 
                 Being unaware in this technological modern age could really lead to some negatives, 
                 let’s say hypothetically an assassins could know your address and lifestyle just from a few clicks. 
                The idea isn’t to scare you but to rather teach you so let’s talk about something that you might not know about. 
                What is a Browser and how do they work? </p>

            <p>The internet is used in everyday life for schoolwork, work, shopping, 
                communication and even posting and reading this blog. 
                This is all achieved with one very important thing that being a browser.
                 A browser also known as internet or web browser is a software program that allows users to access and make use of the World Wide 
                 Web allowing users to access pages, images and videos throughout the internet (What Is a Browser, and What Browsers Are Available?, 2018). 
                 There are many different Browsers, however, the first Browser was known as the WorldWideWeb and was created when a British scientist named Tim Berners-Lee 
                 invented the World Wide Web (Gregersen, n.d.). The most common browsers used today are Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome and Opera.</p>

            <p>Knowing what a Browser is, is easy to know what exactly a Browser does requires more explanation. 
                Simply a Browser can be considered as a rendering engine that downloads web pages and renders them in a form that everyday humans can understand (Nadalin, 2018).
                 Browsers are able to display these Webpages largely due to HyperText Transfer Protocol or HTTP, HTTP can be seen as the set of instructions that Browsers 
                 need to follow to actually interpret and display these Webpages as they define how the Webpage should be formatted and transmitted (Beal, n.d.).
                  HTTP is how the web clients and web servers communicate, when a user types something in their web address or URL the Browser sends an HTTP command to the web servers
                   and receives the Web page being requested and displays onto a user’s device such as a computer, phone or tablet (Beal, n.d.). For the Browser to display the text,
                    image or video that is being requested by the user it makes use of a rendering engine that translates the data of the text, image or video, The data needs to be
                     translated as it is written in Hypertext Markup Language or HTML (What Is a Web Browser?, n.d.). The code that makes up a Browser is a modular thing made up of 
                     different components, the main components of a web browser is The User Interface, The Browser Engine, The Rendering Engine, Networking, JavaScript Interpreter,
                      UI Backend and Data Persistence/Storage (Raghuwanshi, 2014).</p>

            <p>The internet is an ever evolving thing and in the next few years more browsers may be created and other may fall away such as internet explorer which only 
                recently stopped being active. With everything that has been said about Browsers there is still many things that can be further discussed about it and I 
                could go on but I have received word that something dangerous is happening and I’ll have to go deal with it in a few moments. Just understand that Browsers 
                are one of the most integral things for you to even be reading this blog in the first place.</p>
