            <P class="double">
            <p>  Before I get started on The Library of Babel I would like to introduce myself.
                 My name Maria Auditore an Italian girl with grey eyes and black hair that moved from Venice Italy when I was 4 years old to Johannesburg South Africa.
                  I wear glasses because I cannot see, my hand writing is almost unreadable and I am a secret assassin, but you would never know by looking at my shy demeanour. 
                  Being an assassin is not the only thing I do, as I work part time in a library and due to this I thought it would be appropriate to talk about the Library of Babel
                   and how it compares to that of the internet as we know it.</p>

            <p>What if it was said that there was a library that was made up of books that contains every single possible form of letter combinations, 
                this means the library not only contains litterateur that has been written but also forms of litterateur that is yet to be written.
                 The reason this is possible is because theoretically the Library of Babel works as an algorithm and this is how it produces these combinations of letters,
                  and there are more than a trillion combinations of these words that can and have been created. This concept is that of the Library of Babel. 
                  The libraries are made up of hexagons and 4 sides of these hexagons are lined with 20 bookshelves, 
                  where the other 2 are passageways dedicated to the physical needs of the librarians.
                   Throughout this seemingly infinite library it contains no 2 books that are directly similar as it may differ from the smallest of changes such as that of the change
                    of 1 word or a change in punctuation. The Library of Babel is a story by Jorge Luis Borges and was first published in 1941.</p>

            <p>The Library of Babel is not just this really amazing concept but has a relation to the internet as a whole. 
                The most basic relation is the fact that any question that someone could ask has already been asked and answered within both the internet and the Library of Babel.
                 Just like the Internet the Library of Babel is vast with information however, 
                 just like the internet not all the information that can be learned is reliable where message can either be completely wrong,
                  mistranslated or seemingly useless entirely. With how vast both are they share the same issue that it can be easy get lost looking 
                  for something specific only to be side tracked for hours on end both seemingly an infinite space filled with collective knowledge from 
                  all around the world. Looking into the librarians themselves they portray the characteristics of the users on the internet often looking and searching for 
                  a book that displays their ideal views and validation of these opinions, such as that of twitter users who group themselves with likeminded people on the 
                  internet to validate their ideas and opinions and those who disagree are seen as outsider. With these librarians though each one is able to create their own 
                  interpretation of the messages they read with all the forms of litterateur they come across within the Library. Thereâ€™s also the portrayal of illegal activities 
                  that may take within the internet being portrayed with the Librarians burning the books of the Library seemingly getting rid of works deemed useless or contradict 
                  their ideal. Both The Library of Babel and the Internet seemingly share a ton of positives as well negatives, however how these similarities are acted upon all 
                  depends on those who interact with the specific platform they are in.</p>
