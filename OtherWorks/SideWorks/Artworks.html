    <p>Hey there! So i'm not good at art, not by a long shot... but yeah I wanted to share some art projects I made! You can be honest if you have any comments to say let me know
        I could always improve! 2 of the art works so fat are dresses that I made while guessing my friends dress so I drew these 2 in hopes I was correct... I was close actually.
        Another work is tattoo ideas I created for my friend he hasn't gotten the tattoo yet and I might just remove it from my website if he ever does get it... You know to hide 
        my identity. Another one of the art works was a drawing of a rhino that I had made as a request from another friend. I had loved drawing as a kid and I always wanted to go into art 
        but then I decided to work as a doctor but I really wanted to have it as a hobby. So this page is dedicated to all the art that I may create while I continue on this website.

      <P>So I have been reciving a decent amount of questions based around what exactly are these artworks and what they are about. Honestly this page is dedicated to displaying me,
        I know I am an assassin and thats what allot of you are here for, but I am still just a human being. This page is completley dedicated to things I find intresting, or have done that
        I am proud off. These artworks are not the best but they just add a little to show I am still a flawed person. These were drawings I did in my free time as I had recently started drawing using 
        a free software known as Krita <a href = "https://krita.org/en/"> Go to their website here!</a>
      </P>
