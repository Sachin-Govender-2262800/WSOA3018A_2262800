    <p>So I wanted to display a page dedicated to my favorite video game series, that being the Assassins Creed franchise! </p>

    <p>  I know, I know how wild is that! An assassin liking an assassin type game, well its true it's reamined as my favorite franchise since the first game.
      The funny thing is I didn't actually finish the first game first I completed the second game and then I went back to the first game. You might be asking however, why does she like this game?
      Well as a kid i fell in love with the assassins creed franchise especially the first one thanks to it being the first game I ever had to actively take notes in, and i loved that 
      level of participation in a game. What really got to me waht the rules of the Assassins creed's well creed. </p>

      <p>There are 3 Tenets that an assassin needs to follow that was introduced in Assassins creed these are:</p>
      <p>1. Stay your blade from the flesh of the innocent.</p>
      <p>2. Draw No attention to Oneself whenever possible.</p>
      <p>3. Never compromise the brotherhood.</p>
      <p>If you'd notice those are very similar... no almost exactly the same rules that I follow I refuse to kill anyone whose innocent or doesn't deserve it. 
        I make sure that I will not be noticed. If you read my first ever assassination blog, <a href = "../../BlogPages/blogs/BlogPages/PersonalBlogs/blog7.html">link here</a> I failed at that but everyone who had 
        seen me had to be killed luckily that was my target and his men. And the last rule I follow is not to compromise the brotherhood or in this case my family. Other than those reasons 
        I have loved the assassisn creed franchise from its gameplay to its story... Thats not entirely true, the story really went down hill after 3rd game and didn't really improve 
        for too long. I haven't played the latest game but I would really like too. I played Origion which was amazing but Odyssey took all the good from Origion and ruined it.
      </p>

    <p>Here is an image of the main character from the first game, this is Altair Ibn-La'Ahad. He only had 2 games one on all platforms and a game soley made on the psp and appeared in 
      Assassins Creed Revelations. He married Maria which fun fact is actually is actually why my pen name is Maria *shock gasps* 
      I told you Maria is just a pen name, I wouldn't give of my real name to you guys.
